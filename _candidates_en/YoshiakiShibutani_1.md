I am currently making a Python implementation on JVM called cafebabepy, using Java. Still work in progress, really. For the REPL (read–eval–print loop), I've let Scala's parser combinator handle the syntactic analysis of cafebabepy.
In this talk, I will explain the overview of cafebabepy and practical syntactic analysis with the parser combinator library using the cafebabepy implementation as examples. Hopefully I can demonstrate how easy it is to use the parser combinators.
