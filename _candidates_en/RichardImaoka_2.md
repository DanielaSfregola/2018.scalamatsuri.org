Akka Stream is a type-safe stream processing library capable of backpressure handling.
Many conference talks were already held about it, and many of dev teams have introduced it in production. However, jargons and unfamiliar concepts might have troubled you.
Akka Stream is “graph”-ical, thus I believe animations of how streams run will greatly help you understand it.
I won’t give you brand new knowledge, but make it as visual and easy to understand as possible. Materialization, exception handling, how it works inside (Akka) Http - these things would become clear after the session.
