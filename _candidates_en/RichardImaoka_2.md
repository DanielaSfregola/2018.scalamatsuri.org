Akka Stream is a type-safe stream processing library capable of backpressure handling.
Many conference talks have already been held about it, and many dev teams have introduced it in production. However, jargon and unfamiliar concepts may still have troubled you.
Akka Stream is “graph”-ical, thus I believe animations of how streams run will greatly help you understand it.
I won’t give you brand new knowledge, but make it as visual and easy to understand as possible. Materialization, exception handling, and how it works inside (Akka) Http should become clear to you after this session.
