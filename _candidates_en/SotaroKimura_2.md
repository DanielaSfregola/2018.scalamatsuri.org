Stream processing has progressed far beyond being an alternative to batch processing and is now considered a unified data processing system.
This session will describe and review OSS stream processing systems such as those listed below,
and will introduce Spark Structured Processing as a recent example of an unified data processing system.

- Lambda Architecture
- Kappa Architecture
- Unified Data Processing

Finally, I will discuss issues that we encountered while running Spark Structured Streaming in production,
what it felt like to run, and caveats that you should keep in mind.
