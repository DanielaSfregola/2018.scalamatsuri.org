Stream processing has come far beyond being an alternative to batch processing, and now it is considered as a unified data processing system.
This session will talk about and review OSS stream processing systems like below,
and will introduce Spark Structured Processing as a recent example of unified data processing system.

- Lambda Architecture
- Kappa Architecture
- Unified Data Processing

Finally, I will discuss issues we encountered upon running Spark Structured Streaming in production,
how it feels like, and caveats you should keep in mind.
