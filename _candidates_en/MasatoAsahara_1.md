Sophisticated OSS Machine Learning (ML) libraries such as Google TensorFlow and XGBoost have emerged. 
However, ML essentially requires a lot of annoying 'tuning' with much trial and error required to achieve high prediction accuracy.
To relieve us from this pain, we have developed a tool which executes a bunch of TensorFlow/XGBoost processes simultaneously 
and calculates prediction scores of trained models at high speed by leveraging Scala and Apache Spark. 
Our tool is also designed to have extensibility to easily employ the upcoming ML OSS.
In this talk, we will unveil our tool and share both the attractive and challenging points of using Spark with Scala.
We will also share our knowledge on how to handle Spark skillfully.
