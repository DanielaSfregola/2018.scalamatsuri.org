Sophisticated OSS Machine Learning (ML) libraries such as Google TensorFlow and XGBoost have emerged. 
On the other hand, ML essentially requires a lot of annoying 'tuning' with much trial and error to achieve high prediction accuracy.
To release us from the pain, we have developed a tool which executes bunch of TensorFlow/XGBoost processes simultaneously 
and calculates prediction scores of trained models at high speed by leveraging Scala and Apache Spark. 
Our tool is also designed to have extensibility to easily employ coming ML OSS.
In this talk, we will unveil our tool and share attractive and challenging points of using Spark with Scala.
We will also share know-how to handle Spark skillfully.
