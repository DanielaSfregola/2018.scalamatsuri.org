Scala as front end development language? Yes!  
Scala can use both the Swing toolkit as well as ScalaFX, a toolkit wrapping JavaFX into Scala. We introduce basics of development GUIs with ScalaFX, go through important UX controls, and discuss methods and pitfalls in keeping your application responsive. 

Since GUI programming is inherently asyncronously, we will touch on events, observables as provided by ScalaFX, and concurrent programming, in particular Futures and Promises. 

While some of the topics require acquaintance with advanced features of Scala, we try to target new-comers to GUI development with Scala(FX).
