With Akka's recent focus, and accomplishment of shipping Akka Streams and having included Reactive Streams (java.util.concurrent.Flow) in the OpenJDK (Java 9), one has to wonder -- what's the next focus point for the Akka toolkit? It actually means continuing where we left off, and adding more types to all APIs (as was already started by Akka Streams), via the introduction of a stable Akka Typed API as well as more integration between Streams and Cluster. In other words -- allowing to build safe, back-pressure aware distributed systems that type-check and can scale out  (or in) according to your needs. In this session, we'll look at the evolution of Akka's APIs and core principles, and how the new APIs allow us to integrate and distribute all things, for building reactive and distributed systems.
