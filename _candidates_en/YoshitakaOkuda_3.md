The book "Reactive Messaging Patterns with the Actor Model（Addison-Wesley Professional）"（RMP）was written by Vaughn Vernon, the author of "Implementing Domain-Driven Design（Addison-Wesley Professional）". This book is about how we can implement "Enterprise Integration Patterns"（EIP） using Akka.
Akka is reactive and resilient. Those characteristics work really well in enterprise systems and systems integrations. As the use of RMP rises, EIP have been established as concrete and modern design options. Although, the number of patterns of RMP and EIP is enormous, having the information only accessible in Japanese is not enough.
In this session, I will share what I have learned and found through the RMP book club held from April 2016 to September 2017.
