Serverless architecture has become widely used as this architecture saves you from having to deal with a variety of difficult tasks such as scalability, security, and infrastructure maintenance.
Although one can easily start a serverless web application, as the size of the web application grows, maintenance costs and the difficulty of said maintenance increases as well.
To tackle this problem, I have applied Domain Driven Design (DDD) to serverless architecture. I then developed a framework based on what I have learned through this process.
In this session, I will explain how to use my framework and its design principle.
This session will show one year's progress from my presentation at the previous ScalaMatsuri conference.
