Serverless Architecture has become widely used as an architecture saves you from variety of hard jobs such as scalability, security and Infrastructure maintenance.
Although you can easily start Serverless Web application, maintenance cost becomes large and maintenance work gets hard as size of web application becomes large.
To tackle this problem, I have applied Domain Driven Design to Serverless Architecture. Then I have developed a framework based on what I have learned through this process.
In this session, I will explain how to use my framework and its design principle.
By the way, I have took 1 year to improve my presentation in the previous ScalaMatsuri.
