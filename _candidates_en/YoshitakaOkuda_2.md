In order to use Akka in production, we also need to pay attention to quality characteristics using logging, monitoring and application life cycle management. Although Akka has a rich tool, it does not cover the area.
In this session, I will introduce a library called squbs developed by PayPal in order to achieve this.
squbs's design principal and tools are completely different from all-in-one frameworks. Unfortunately they do not have enough information in Japanese. So, it would be happy for me if this session cloud provide useful information to you.
(By the way, I am not a contributor. I just want to let you know my favorite tool ;-D)
