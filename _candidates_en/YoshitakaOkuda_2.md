In order to use Akka in production, we also need to pay attention to logging, monitoring and application life cycle. Although Akka has a rich tool set, it does not cover the above in production level.
In this session, I will introduce a library called squbs developed by PayPal in order to achieve the goal above.
Squbs's design principal and tools are completely different from all-in-one frameworks. Unfortunately, they do not have enough information in Japanese. So, it would make me happy if this session could provide useful information to you.
(By the way, I am not a contributor; I just want to let you know about my favorite tool ;-D)
