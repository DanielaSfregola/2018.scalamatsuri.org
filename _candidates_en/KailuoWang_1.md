Cats 1.0 is on the horizon (should be released by the end of year 2017). This introduction talk will explain why a Scala team should care about Cats or FP libraries based on category theory in general. More specifically, this talk will focus on how category theory based FP libs like Cats enables better composition in programming. Towards the end of the talk, I will also give an update of the current status of the Cats project and its future roadmap.
