In this talk, I will be sharing my experience on streaming processing over last 6 years.
From 6 years ago, I started my journey in 500.com to write my first streaming processing application to do Active user counting by using Storm.
About three years ago, I started to use Spark streaming to implement incremental machine learning application in my second company Lazada Group, which is the largest e-commerce company in Southeast Asia.
Now, We are using Flink to do stateful stream processing and complex event processing in Grab, where we are data and technology to drive Southeast Asia forward and transform the way people travel and pay across the region.
In this sessoin, I will explain how does the different framework work in different cases, and why we decided to choose Flink in Scala.
Beyond that, we are using Scala as our main programming language for both Flink and Spark.
