As Scala developers, it is not uncommon to find ourselves struggling against the compiler. And although the compiler tries to communicate with us, the result can be both incomprehensible and one-sided. 

In this beginner-friendly talk, we will see how we can improve things by sharing our thoughts with the compiler. Be it by using more descriptive types, leveraging implicits, or even churning out some macros. By this simple act of sharing, we can elevate our relationship with the compiler into a meaningful, and hopefully productive, dialog.
