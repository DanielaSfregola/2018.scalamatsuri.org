You're doing big data. You're using the tools that are hot: Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, a NoSQL database. But have you looked carefully if you're using the right patterns and practices? In the open source data engineering community, we should work together to share experiences and lessons learned, in the same way as tools and architectures are shared. Therefore, this talk will dive into some common pattern that can help you think about your data-driven software and platforms. All code is written in Scala. Join this session to get inspired and to ignite the discussion!
