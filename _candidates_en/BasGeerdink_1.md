You've heard about machine learning, data science, cloud, reactive systems, AI, and APIs. How to combine these? How to start a journey to develop self-learning systems in the cloud? In this talk, Bas will provide a reference architecture for these kind of systems. He uses a hands-on approach to explain and demo architectural concepts, principles and best practices. Join this session if you're creating AI-systems yourself, or if you want to get inspired by what's possible.
