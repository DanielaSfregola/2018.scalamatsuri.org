Rapidly building scalable, concurrent applications that don't leak memory and threads has proven all but impossible for procedural and object-oriented programming. Scala frameworks like Akka have simplifed parts of this problem, but only by sacrificing equational reasoning, type safety, and modular composability, all of which dramatically increase development and maintenance costs.

In this presentation, you'll learn how to build applications with Scalaz 8 IO, a powerful, purely functional effect system that will help you build type-safe, concurrent, scalable, and non-leaky applications, faster and easier than ever before. By the end of the session, John hopes you'll agree that purely functional programming is the only practical, Enterprise-grade choice for the working programmer.
