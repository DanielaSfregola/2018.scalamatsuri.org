There has been heated discussions about the dream of practical quantum computers.
Talking about quantum theories, although Sci-Fi stories like "Schrödinger's cat" are interesting,
programmers would be interested in algorithms on those quantum computers. 

Surprisingly, if you know the mathematics of matrix calculation in complex numbers, 
you can implement algorithms that work on computers based on quantum gates.  

However, it is a hard and tedious job to manually perform complex number matrix calculation.   
Are you probably dreaming of a programming language, which allows you easily implement a wide variety of such matrix calculation 
in a way close to mathematic equations, also assuring type safety?  

Yes, I know such a pretty language. Exactly, our common language, Scala!

I'll show you techniques like augmented methods and type-level integers and how to use them on quantum computers.
