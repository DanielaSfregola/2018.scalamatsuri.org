The case for forking the Scala development toolchain - and the case against it. Scala has the reputation of being hard to write tooling for, yet it is a vital part of the development experience. I want to present an overview of existing tools from writing code to building, testing and deploying it, how they are lacking, where better solutions exist outside of Scala Land and how we can improve it.
