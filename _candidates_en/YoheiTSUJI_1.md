DDD (domain driven design) is becoming obsolete in recent product development.

Scala's powerful language features and abundant expressiveness are also compatible with DDD, but on the other
hand, DDD specific abstraction is also high, there is no clear answer on how to design and implement it, there
are lots of hesitations.

In this attend, we introduce an example of DDD practice at Scala based on field experience.

* It will be a revised version of the content we talked about at Scala Kansai Summit 2017 in September and
KanJava '17 in October.
* I will focus on the contents for medium and advanced users this time, and I would like to talk about
incorporating further knowledge.
