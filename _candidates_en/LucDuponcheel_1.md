In his Turing award winning lecture, John Backus presented FP, a programming system promoting a point-free functional programming style based upon Functions, Composition, Construction and Condition. FP closely corresponds to Arrows as introduced by John Hughes. Point-free programming has, traditionally, been considered to be rather cumbersome. The good news is that Scala comes to the rescue by spicing this style with a DSL flavor that makes point-free program descriptions almost look like native Scala programs. The talk goes both into the details of the design of a library and it's usage. Among others it goes into details on how implicit functions can greatly reduce boilerplate code.
