Learning any new thing is really exciting and sometimes can be intimidating. I want to help out people and teach them on how to get started learning Scala guiding them through right steps. After my talk, I want to make sure everyone in the audience walks out with a strong understanding of the following:
Case classes and pattern matching.
Collection library- map, fold, reduce, filter.
Future/Promise and Akka.
And a few more.
