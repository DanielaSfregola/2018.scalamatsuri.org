Making State Machines safe, composable, and practical using types -- the author of Idris has boldly taken on the dream of humankind, and achieve it through an abstraction called Control.ST library (http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/st/).

In this session, I will show what Control.ST is, and how it can be used. Even though it was originally written in Idris with dependent types, we will also look into how far we can take Scala to mimic it. See also 'State Machines All The Way Down' paper (https://www.idris-lang.org/drafts/sms.pdf).
