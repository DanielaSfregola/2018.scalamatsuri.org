Category Theory has become one of the hot topics in the community. Why is this theory suddenly so interesting for developers? Why are the cool kids talking so much about it? 

This talk will introduce the general principles of Category Theory in a pragmatic, non-mathematical way. We will show practical examples of how this theory has managed to simplify and solve common challenges that we encounter in our code daily, such as nullable values, error handling, parallel and sequential operations and data validation. Also, we will apply them to create our own category theory library from scratch using ScalaCheck as the only dependency.
