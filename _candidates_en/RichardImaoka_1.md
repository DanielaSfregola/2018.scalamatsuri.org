Akka is a toolkit for building concurrent, distributed systems in Java and Scala. After 6 years from the first release, it became prevalent, but there has been criticism about lack of type safety in Akka Actor.
Akka Typed comes with type safety and composability to solve this problem, and also an exciting and actively developed project.
I will talk about the history, project status, fun part, but also difficulty and challenges of Akka Typed. And I hope you become eager to try it out, and also want to help prospective contributors.
